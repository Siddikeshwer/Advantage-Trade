**Why This Matters:**
This project showcases how AI and modern development tools can democratize financial analysis. Using Cursor AI and Streamlit, I was able to rapidly prototype and deploy a sophisticated financial dashboard that would traditionally require weeks of development.

**Development Experience:**
The combination of Cursor AI's intelligent code assistance and Streamlit's intuitive framework made it possible to build this complex application in record time. The AI-powered development environment helped me focus on the core logic while handling boilerplate code efficiently.
